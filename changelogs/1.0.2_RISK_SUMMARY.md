# Belladonna 1.0.2 Executive Risk Summary (Draft)

Audience: Board / Audit / Security Leadership (non‑engineering)
Date: 2025-09-04
Scope: Residual risks and planned mitigations after 1.0.1 hardening release.

## 1. Business Value Position
Belladonna now functions as a production‑grade privileged action mediation layer with:
- Strong replay & time integrity (monotonic clock + nonce namespaces)
- Policy governance & drift traceability (segmented hashes, diff tooling)
- Durable audit chain (crash‑safe, tamper‑evident)
- Incident response controls (multi‑party signed unfreeze tokens)
- Supply chain transparency (SBOM + attestations + dependency policy gates)
This materially reduces fraud / abuse surface for controlled system operations and improves forensic readiness.

## 2. Residual Risk Overview
| Category | Residual Risk | Business Impact | Current Safeguard | Planned Mitigation (1.0.2) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Cryptographic Assurance | Interim simplified signature check (pseudo-Ed25519 stub) could be weaker vs full verification | Potential downgrade of trust in unfreeze approvals if attacker gains file access | Token replay prevention + expiry + namespace separation | Replace stub with audited Ed25519 library & formal test vectors |
| Operational Ergonomics | CLI‑only policy diff & no golden config bundles | Slower review cycles; human error in change evaluation | Human-readable diff summaries | JSON diff mode + curated baseline config packs + optional lightweight web UI |
| Audit Throughput Scaling | Per-entry fsync may bottleneck at very high event rates | Performance degradation under bursty audit workloads | Crash-consistent chain & size guard | Batch commit (N-entry) + periodic Merkle anchor & integrity beacon |
| Adaptive Decoy Tuning | Auto adjustments lack upper guardrail | Possible resource drift / false escalations in edge workloads | Suppression window & threshold smoothing | Add mode-specific max decoy cap + telemetry on tuning decisions |
| Kernel Divergence | Sandbox hash differences across kernel versions not surfaced proactively | Silent policy weakening on new kernels | Matrix CI detects regressions | Add runtime alert when sandbox hash != baseline per kernel ID |
| Disaster Recovery Execution | Runbook exists but no automated drill | Confidence decay / latent breakage in incident path | Manual unfreeze tests | CI scenario simulating freeze → signed unfreeze workflow |
| Game Mode Sampling Lag | Relaxed sampling extends detection window | Extended exposure during stealth attacks | Minimum interval + jitter floor | Export metric integrity_expected_delay_seconds & alert on drift |
| Observability Accuracy | Latency percentiles use naive approximation | Potential SLO misinterpretation | Basic streaming estimators | Introduce HDR histogram / exponential buckets with rotation |
| Human Factors / Misconfiguration | Incorrect policy / key handling still possible | Accidental privilege exposure | Epoch monotonicity / hash diff | Golden config templates + preflight lint severity gates (DONE) |
| Supply Chain Trust Residual | Upstream crate compromise risk | Indirect exploit path | cargo deny / audit / vet gating | Add periodic SBOM diff & anomaly alerting |

## 3. Top 5 Priority Mitigations (Q4 Window)
1. Replace pseudo signature logic with real Ed25519 verification + negative test vectors.
2. Introduce audit batching + Merkle anchor every 100 entries.
3. JSON machine-readable policy diff + golden baseline config bundle.
4. Sandbox hash divergence alerting & kernel->hash inventory catalog.
5. Recovery drill CI: scripted freeze → multi-signed unfreeze scenario.

## 4. Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) To Add
- signature_verification_fail_rate
- audit_write_batch_latency_ms (post batching)
- decoy_auto_adjustments_total & decoy_adjustment_rejects_total
- sandbox_hash_drift_events_total
- recovery_drill_last_success_timestamp
- integrity_expected_delay_seconds (game mode) baseline vs actual

## 5. Acceptance & Appetite
Current residual risk profile is acceptable for production rollout provided cryptographic assurance upgrade (Ed25519) is prioritized in 1.0.2 and audit throughput enhancements land before large-scale expansion.

## 6. Summary Statement
Belladonna’s 1.0.1 release closes the primary systemic integrity, replay, governance, and supply chain gaps identified in 1.0.0. Remaining exposure is concentrated in (a) formal cryptographic verification hardening, (b) scale ergonomics & batching, and (c) operational drill automation. These are bounded, well-scoped, and scheduled for the 1.0.2 cycle.
