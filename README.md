# Belladonna Play

This repository is now private while we transition away from an open-source distribution for Belladonna Play.

What’s next
- We plan to open‑source the HAL layer and select developer tooling in a dedicated repo.
- Runtime anti‑cheat features and DRM integrations will remain closed‑source for now.

Status
- Current internal version: v0.0.1 foundation (Linux‑only).
- Public releases and assets have been removed.

For updates on the open‑sourcing of HAL and tooling, watch this space or contact the maintainers.
