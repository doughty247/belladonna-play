# Olivine Privilege Bridge - Security Design Document

## Overview
A secure, automated privilege escalation system written in Rust to handle system-level operations without user intervention while maintaining maximum security.

## Security Requirements
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only specific, whitelisted commands allowed
2. **Command Validation**: All commands validated against strict allowlists
3. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all privileged operations
4. **Secure Communication**: Encrypted IPC between Olivine engine and bridge
5. **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits to prevent DoS
6. **Capability-based Security**: Use Linux capabilities instead of full sudo when possible

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Olivine Privilege Daemon** (`olivine-privd`) - Rust daemon running as root
2. **Olivine Bridge Client** (`olivine-bridge`) - Python/Rust client library
3. **Policy Engine** - Command validation and authorization
4. **Audit System** - Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Communication Flow
```
Olivine Engine (user) → Unix Socket → Privilege Daemon (root) → System Commands
                                  ↓
                              Audit Log
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Daemon
- Rust-based daemon with minimal attack surface
- Unix domain socket communication
- Command allowlist validation
- Basic audit logging

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security
- Command parameter validation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Capability-based restrictions
- Enhanced audit trails

### Phase 3: Integration
- Python client library integration
- Olivine engine integration
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and alerting

## Security Features

### Command Allowlist
Only these specific commands will be permitted:
- `iw dev <interface> set power_save <on|off>`
- `iw dev <interface> get power_save`
- `cpufreq-set -g <governor>`
- Network interface queries
- System resource monitoring

### Validation Rules
- Interface names must match known patterns
- Parameters must be from predefined sets
- No shell metacharacters allowed
- Path traversal protection
- Command injection prevention

### Audit Requirements
- All commands logged with timestamps
- User context and PID tracking
- Command results and exit codes
- Resource usage monitoring
- Security event alerting
