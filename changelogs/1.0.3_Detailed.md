Fixed Issues:
Unused import warning: Removed the unused CveSeverity import from main.rs
Dead code warnings: Added #[allow(dead_code)] annotations to config fields in monitoring structures:
AdaptiveDefenseMonitor.config in adaptive_defense.rs
HydraParanoidMonitor.config in adaptive_defense.rs
EbpfRolloutMonitor.rollout_start_time in adaptive_defense.rs
SupplyChainMonitor.config in src/supply_chain.rs
ReliabilityMonitor.config in reliability.rs
These config fields are intentionally kept for future extensibility and configuration customization, so suppressing the dead code warnings is appropriate.
